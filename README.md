# Dance Atlas NYC
This repo serves as the source for the ongoing effort to create a dance studio database website with compiled dance class information readily made available to dancers. Current studios being included include Peridance, BDC, Modega, etc. 


### About 
There are two main directories in this project: \

**/database** includes the studio crawler written in python and serves to periodically crawl all the studios currently crawlable by the configurations in the NYC area.
 
**/dance-atlas-nyc** includes the full-stack Next.js app which hosts the website itself and api that allows for users to query and search for available dance classes.

### Compatibility
This build uses chromedriver-win64 ver 120 compatible with Chrome 120.x versions. Update chromdriver installation and system PATH variables for Chromdriver compatibility. 

### WIP Features

### Usage
